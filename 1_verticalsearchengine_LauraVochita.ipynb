Although, Google performs worse than my search engine for 1 search query the score difference is just 0.03, whereas for the ones where Google perfroms better, we have a difference in score of 0.8 and 0.66, respectively, which is significantly higher.

What is the main barrier when it fails to retrieve a relevant document (is it on the user's end in the query formulation, is it on the system's end in the ranking component, or is in the document's end in the way information is expressed?)   In what situations are the limitations harmful?  Is there a way to compensate for these?   For which kinds of tasks would this imperfect tool already be very useful?    What would be different if advanced computational language understanding was possible?   Etc."

        "Altough on very specific search queries Google performed significantly better, I decided it would be insightful to also search for a very generic related topic such as \"scientists\". By not including the words \"female\" or \"women\", I want to analyze Google's results in comparison to my search engine's. For this search query and my interest, a result here is considered relevant if it talks about women scientists.\n",
        "\n",
        "For \"scientists\" query on my search engine, all of the results on the first page were reffering to female scientists, as this is the way in which it was programmed. On the other hand, on Google, only the second page included a webpage about women in science. In this instance, my search engine obviously has a much better precision.\n",
        "\n",
        "However, it is worth noting that this search query is extremely general. Therefore, Google mainly showed definitions of the word or webpages about science programmes, regardless of gender. \n",
        "\n",
        "This example is a good way to investigate the linmitations of text-based searching. It turns out, that when looking for more specific keywords, Google performs quite well. However, general text-based searching might not always return desired results. \n",
        "\n",
        "Another aspect worth noting here, based on the returned scores, is that both engines performed equally well, even perfectly, for the most specific keyword search which was \"women scientists in action\". On the other hand, in day to day usage, you might not think of using this ultra speficic keywording, as when you search for something, more often than not you don't already have a page in mind. \n",
        "\n",
        "My conclusion here, is that when a search engine fails to retrieve relevant information is always a combination of factors. From the user's perspective, the keywords employed might not be specific enough, or particularly descriptive of their desired results. As exemplified above, a search engine like Google has no way to know that by searching for \"scientist\", I actually expect information about female scientists, and not just general facts/ useful websites for people who activate in the field. Secondly, the ways in which the search engines operate also play a major role. Their operating systems should be, in my opinion, better attuned to natural language and natural thought process expectations. Ideally, search engines will be able to operate similarly to conversations with people, where the user doesn't need to make usage of extremely specific keywords to retrieve information, as the person on the other end of the coversation has great ability for interpreation and context evaluation. I think the content of the document itself might be the factor that least influences this, as, in my experience, it is extremely rare for them not to hold relevant titles and descriptions. \n",

        "As briefly touched upon in the begining of this assignment, these 'errors' become harmful when access to information is restricted or biased. If I were to search, for example, \"top 10 scientists in the world\" and it took me 3 pages to find one article that included a woman, that would have been a problem. "
